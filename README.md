# Injuries-and-the-NFL-Bye-Week-Safely-Adding-an-18th-Game

I published an article for the Bruin Sports Analytics club at UCLA in which I used NFL injury report data to analyze the effects of the NFL bye week on mitigating injuries. I was primarily concerned with the possibility of adding an 18th game without increasing injury counts and I predicted whether this was doable by adding a second bye week for each NFL team. I worked in R to create and alter dataframes, used ggplot2 to create graphs, and made my predictions using linear regression. The following url is the link to my published article: https://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/post/bye-week. The code file within this repository contains the code I wrote to create my graphs and make my predictions. I used the csv files from 2016 to 2023 found at the following link as the data for my project (I ignored data before 2016 because there was a change to NFL injury report procedures beginning in 2016) : https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse-data/releases/tag/injuries. I have also attached to this repository the final data frame I worked with once I added columns based on bye weeks and combined all the data frames for each year.
